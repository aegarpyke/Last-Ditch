Original idea for the Entity-Component system taken from Chris Powell's series of articles [here](http://cbpowell.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/entity-component-game-programming-using-jruby-and-libgdx-part-1/). He has his whole tutorial project in this [repo](https://github.com/cpowell/ruby-entity-component-framework).

[libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html) - An excellent library.

[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) - An excellent way to communicate with the JVM.
