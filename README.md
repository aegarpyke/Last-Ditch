There are massive sprawling cities across Earth. They are filled with skyscrapers that reach hundreds of stories into the air. For hundreds of years, the rich have been building away from the less fortunate on the lower levels. There are now large abandonded sections left in their wake. These have become the perfect place for anyone who doesn't want to be seen anymore.

And it's your new home...

Original idea for the Entity-Component system taken from Chris Powell's series of articles [here](http://cbpowell.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/entity-component-game-programming-using-jruby-and-libgdx-part-1/). He has his whole tutorial project in this [repo](https://github.com/cpowell/ruby-entity-component-framework).

[libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html) - For producing an excellent library.

[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) - For allowing me to talk to the JVM in a pleasing manner.
