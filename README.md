Premise

After the destabilization of the United States, massive development began to slowly build up around the newly formed Central Government established in Valencia, Venezuela. For hundreds of years, the rich have been building up and away from the poor on the lower levels. There are now large abandonded sections left in their wake. These have become the perfect place for anyone who doesn't want to be seen anymore.

And it's your new home...

Original idea for the Entity-Component system taken from Chris Powell's series of articles [here](http://cbpowell.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/entity-component-game-programming-using-jruby-and-libgdx-part-1/). He has his whole tutorial project in this [repo](https://github.com/cpowell/ruby-entity-component-framework).

[libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html) - An excellent library.

[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) - An excellent way to communicate with the JVM.
