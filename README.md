It's 3257. Earth now has a number of massive sprawling cities. Thickets of skyscrapers for acres that reach hundreds of stories into the air. For hundreds of years, the rich have been building higher and higher. There are now large abandonded sections left in their wake. Sections that are too large to be worth heavily policing. They are the perfect place for anyone who doesn't want to be seen doing whatever it is they're doing...

Original idea for the Entity-Component system taken from Chris Powell's series of articles [here](http://cbpowell.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/entity-component-game-programming-using-jruby-and-libgdx-part-1/). He has his whole tutorial project in this [repo](https://github.com/cpowell/ruby-entity-component-framework).

[libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html) - For producing an excellent library.

[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) - For allowing me to talk to the JVM in a pleasing manner.
